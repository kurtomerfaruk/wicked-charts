==Highcharts has a different license than wicked-charts. Is that a problem?==
The Highcharts JS library is not shipped with wicked-charts. wicked-charts simply references the publicly available JS library from highcharts.com. If you want to use wicked-charts for commercial projects, consult http://shop.highsoft.com/highcharts.html and buy a license.

==The javascript files for the JQuery and Highcharts library are loaded from the web by default. How can I use my own versions of these javascript files?==

Simply call `JavaScriptResourceRegistry.setJQueryReference(...)` from the init() method of your wicket application and provide a new URL or a reference to a javascript file in your own packages.

==How can I set a Color explicitly to (javascript) null?==
See java class <a href="http://wicked-charts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wicked-charts-parent/apidocs/com/googlecode/wickedcharts/highcharts/options/color/NullColor.html">NullColor</a>.
