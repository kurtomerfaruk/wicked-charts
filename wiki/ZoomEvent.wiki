=Zoom / Select a portion of a chart

*Supported by:* _wicked-charts-wicket6_
----

Highcharts and Wicked Charts support zooming (see ChartOptions.setZoomType()). The user may select a portion of the x or y axis of a chart.

Highcharts provides the selection event to hook into and respond to the selection the user made (see http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#chart.events.selection). WickedCharts provides the [https://wicked-charts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wicked-charts-parent/apidocs/com/googlecode/wickedcharts/highcharts/options/interaction/SelectionFunction.html SelectionFunction] to respond to this event on the server side.

== Using SelectionFunction ==
The [https://wicked-charts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wicked-charts-parent/apidocs/com/googlecode/wickedcharts/highcharts/options/interaction/SelectionFunction.html SelectionFunction] must be added to the selection Event of the https://wicked-charts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wicked-charts-parent/apidocs/com/googlecode/wickedcharts/highcharts/options/ChartOptions.html ChartOptions] as follows:

{{{

chartOptions
        .setEvents(new Events()
            .setSelection(new SelectionFunction(this) {

              @Override
              public void onSelect(final SelectionEvent event) {
                System.out
                    .println("Current Min Value of X-Axis: " + event
                        .getxAxes()
                        .get(0)
                        .getMin());
                System.out
                    .println("Current Max Value of X-Axis: " + event
                        .getxAxes()
                        .get(0)
                        .getMax());

              }
            }));

}}}

== Using Wicket 6.x ==
Using Wicket 6, you can also access the Wicket AjaxRequestTarget on the server side to implement partial page updates. You simply have to cast the SelectionEvent to [https://wicked-charts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wicked-charts-parent/apidocs/com/googlecode/wickedcharts/wicket6/highcharts/features/selection/WicketSelectionEvent.html WicketSelectionEvent] as follows:

{{{
events.setSelection(new SelectionFunction(options){
  @Override
  public void onSelect(SelectionEvent event) {
    WicketSelectionEvent wicketEvent = (WicketSelectionEvent) event;
    AjaxRequestTarget target = wicketEvent.getAjaxRequestTarget();
           
    // re-render some component
    target.add(...);
  }
}
}}}
