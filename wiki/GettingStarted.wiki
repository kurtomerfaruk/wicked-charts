#getting started with wicked-charts

= General Concept =

Wicked Charts does not create charts itself, but delegates the creation of the charts to the Highcharts JavaScript library. Wicked Charts provides you with two things:
 * Java classes to define the content of a chart
 * Components for Wicket and JSF which are able to call Highcharts to show a chart defined by you
