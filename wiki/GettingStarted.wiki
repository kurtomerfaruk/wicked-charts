= General Concept =
Wicked Charts does not create charts itself, but delegates the creation of the charts to the Highcharts JavaScript library. Wicked Charts provides you with two things:
 * Java classes to define the content of a chart, starting from the Options class
 * Components for Wicket and JSF which are able to call Highcharts to display a chart defined by you

= Defining a Chart =
To define the contents of a chart, you simply have to instantiate an Options object and use its setter methods to define the data and metadata you want. This Options object is then passed into a web component that takes care of the rendering.

The following example creates a line chart displaying the months from January to December on the X-Axis and the average temperature in this month that has been measured in Tokyo and New York.
