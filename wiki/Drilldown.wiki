=Drilldown=

*Supported by:* _wicked-charts-wicket15, wicked-charts-wicket6_

The term "drilldown" actually defines the act of moving from a general chart to a more specific chart that shows more detailed information that the one before. Here, it simply means clicking on a chart with the result that the chart changes its content. Technically, it means that the [https://wicked-charts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wicked-charts-parent/apidocs/com/googlecode/wickedcharts/highcharts/options/Options.html Options] of the chart are exchanged when the user clicks on a certain point of the chart.

For each point in a chart, drilldown can be activated separately, by adding a [https://wicked-charts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wicked-charts-parent/apidocs/com/googlecode/wickedcharts/highcharts/options/drilldown/DrilldownPoint.html DrilldownPoint] instead of a normal [https://wicked-charts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wicked-charts-parent/apidocs/com/googlecode/wickedcharts/highcharts/options/series/Point.html Point] to a series:

{{{
// define the options to appear initially
Options mainOptions = ...;

// define the options to appear when the point is clicked
Options drilldownOptions = ...;

// define the point that should trigger the drilldown on click
mainOptions.addSeries(new PointSeries()
  . addPoint(new DrilldownPoint(options, drilldownOptions)
    .setY(5));

}}}

*Please note that if you define many DrilldownPoints each pointing to different drilldown-Options in a single chart each drilldown options will be rendered into the page as JSON object. That means that the drilldown feature does not scale endlessly!*
