Wicked Charts provides an API for localizing certain elements of your charts. The class to use for this is [https://wicked-charts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wicked-charts-parent/apidocs/com/googlecode/wickedcharts/highcharts/options/LanguageOptions.html LanguageOptions].

Then simply add the Theme to your chart as described on the [UsingThemes] page.
