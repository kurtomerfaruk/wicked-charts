=Live Updating Charts=

*Supported by*: _wicked-charts-wicket6_
----

You can configure a chart to regularly and automatically add a new point to the chart. This currently works only for charts containing a single series. You can use this feature by adding a [https://wicked-charts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wicked-charts-parent/apidocs/com/googlecode/wickedcharts/highcharts/options/livedata/LiveDataSeries.html LiveDataSeries] to your chart.

The following code will add a series to your chart that will be updated each second with the current timestamp as x value and a random value between 0 and 1 as y value.

{{{
LiveDataSeries series = new LiveDataSeries(options, 1000) {
  @Override
  public Coordinate<Number, Number> update(){
    return new Coordinate<Number, Number>(
      new Date().getTime(), Math.random());
    }
  }
}
}}}
