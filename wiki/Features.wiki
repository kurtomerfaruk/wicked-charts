= Basic Chart Types =

Highcharts and thus Wicked Charts support a set of different chart types that are listed in the [https://wicked-charts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wicked-charts-parent/apidocs/com/googlecode/wickedcharts/highcharts/options/SeriesType.html SeriesType] enumeration. Basic chart types only need the file highcharts.js to work properly while advanced charts additionally need the file highcharts_more.js to work.

For an example of how to create a basic charts with Wicket and JSF please consult the [Getting Started] page.

The basic chart types are:


== wicked-charts-wicket15 & wicked-charts-wicket6==
Basic charts are all supported by the wicket implementations of Wicked Charts. The needed javascript files are automatically added to your page when you add the Chart component to your page.

== wicked-charts-jsf12 ==
When using JSF you currently have to include the file highcharts.js manually to your page. You can grab the file at http://code.highcharts.com/.
