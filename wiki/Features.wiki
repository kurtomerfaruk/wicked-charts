= Advanced Chart Types =
The advances chart types need the javascript file highcharts_more.js to work.

The advances chart types are:
 * gauge charts 
 * column range charts
 * area range charts

All chart types and the java code needed to create them can be viewed online in the [http://wicked-charts.appspot.com Showcase].

== Using Wicket ==
You have nothing to care about, since the Wicket components take care of loading the correct javascript files needed for the chart types.

== Using JSF ==
You have to include the following javascript files manually into your page:
 * http://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js
 * http://code.highcharts.com/highcharts-more.js
