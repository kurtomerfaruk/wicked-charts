= Basic Charts =

Highcharts and thus Wicked Charts support a set of different chart types that are listed in the com.googlecode.wickedcharts.highcharts.options.SeriesType enumeration. Basic chart types only need the file highcharts.js to work properly while advanced charts additionally need the file highcharts_more.js to work.
